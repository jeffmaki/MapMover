MapMover
========

MapMover was an interactive system that allowed participants to produce an audio-based expression of the city by collecting and playing field recordings which were visualized on a large-scale physical map using a mechatronic device and LED cursor. 

MapMover was commissioned as part of the international exhibition “Making Things Public: Atmospheres of Democracy” at the Center for Art and Media (ZKM) in Karlsruhe, Germany in 2005 (Curated by Bruna Latour, Peter Weibel, and Steve Dietz).
